@ Handle IRQs by calling the matching ISR.
@ Tasks of this function:
@   - read IE & IF and determine which IRQ was raised
@   - acknowledge that IRQ (both in IF and IF_BIOS)
@   - check if that IRQ has a matching ISR
@       - if not, return
@       - if ISR exists continue
@   - switch to System Mode
@   - call the ISR
@   - switch to IRQ Mode
@
@ It should be uncommon for multiple IRQs to be raised at the same time,
@ so the function only serves one interrupt and then exits. In the event
@ that other bits were to be set, the BIOS would simply call this
@ function again.
