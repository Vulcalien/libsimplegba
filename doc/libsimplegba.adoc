== NAME
libsimplegba - overview of libsimplegba

== DESCRIPTION
This library offers functions and constants useful when interfacing with
hardware components of the Game Boy Advance, plus some other utilities.

The library contains two files needed for compilation: _lnkscript_
(linker script) and _crt0.s_ (startup code).

=== Misc

*Base <base.h>*::
Basic definitions, such as data types (u8, i32, bool...), their MIN/MAX
constants (*I32_MIN*, *U16_MAX*...), the NULL pointer, section macros
(*IWRAM_SECTION*, *SBSS_SECTION*...), etc.

*Math <math.h>*::
Various mathematical functions for integers and fixed-point numbers,
including basic trigonometry.

*Random <random.h>*::
Pseudorandom number generator, offering the _random_ function and other
related functions.

*Memory <memory.h>*::
Manipulate memory. This module contains replacements for some C standard
library functions like _memset_ and _memcpy_, providing
alignment-specific versions (e.g., memset16, memcpy32) as well.

=== GBA Hardware

*Display <gba/display.h>*::
Basic display functions, such as configuring the Video Mode or getting a
pointer to the bitmap raster. Graphic effects are also included.

*Background <gba/background.h>*::
Configure and interact with the GBA display's background layers.

*Sprite <gba/sprite.h>*::
Configure and interact with the GBA display's sprites (objects).

*Window <gba/window.h>*::
Configure the GBA display's windows.

*Audio <gba/audio.h>*::
Audio driver interface, supporting two direct sound channels.

*Timer <gba/timer.h>*::
Configure and interact with the GBA's four timers.

*DMA <gba/dma.h>*::
Configure and interact with the GBA's four DMA channels, using them to
make memory transfers.

*Input <gba/input.h>*::
Interact with the GBA's buttons and D-Pad.

*Interrupt <gba/interrupt.h>*::
Enable or disable interrupt requests and set callback functions (ISRs)
that handle those requests.

*System <gba/system.h>*::
System control interface, including constants such as the GBA's clock
frequency.

*Cartridge <gba/cartridge.h>*::
Access information about the cartridge, such as its header.

*Backup <gba/backup.h>*::
Store data to and retrieve data from the cartridge's backup chip.

=== Debug

*Profiler <debug/profiler.h>*::
Profile a piece of code, obtaining an indicative count of the CPU clock
cycles required to run it.

*mGBA <debug/mgba.h>*::
Interface with the debug registers of the mGBA emulator, allowing to
print text similarly to how the standard output is used in computer
programs.
